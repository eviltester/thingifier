Build the full project

`mvn package`

Getting build errors?

What does `mvn -version` tell you about the Java verison being used?

Switch to the right java version:

export JAVA_HOME=`/usr/libexec/java_home -v 11.0`

For heroku:

NOTE: need to have `heroku plugins:install java` for the `deploy:jar` to be recognised - more info https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-executable-jar-files

Deploy the challenger app full jar

- have the deployment page open in case we need to rollback
    - https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/apichallenges/activity
- view the logs to watch release progress
    - https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/apichallenges/logs
- cd challenger
- `heroku deploy:jar target/apichallenges.jar --app apichallenges`
- change ChallengerAuto to point to apichallenges.herokuapp.com and run the tests
- roll back on any issues
