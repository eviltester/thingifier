# Simulation Mode

The API has a simulation mode, it uses hard coded data in responses, but tries to mimic some conditions.

## About Simulation Mode

The API simulation mode, uses hard coded data for responses, but tries to mimic conditions e.g. JSON vs XML payloads.

The simulator is stateless and does not track your usage, making it deterministic for multiple users. Which means:

*   Entities created do not show in the 'entities' call, but can be retrieved by a 'GET'
*   Entities deleted do not show in the 'entities' and respond to a 404, but the delete for them will return a 200... you can only delete 'specific' entities, other entities will respond with a forbidden request.
*   There are 'inconsistencies' but they are logical based on the needs of a stateless simulator. Use the actual API that underpins the challenges or the Simple API if you want a 'real' API.

## How to Use

Work through the requests in sequence to achieve a fairly logical interaction.

- try different tooling, the only difference then will be the tool because the API is fairly forgiving and no-one else can interfere with your practice. Use it to learn the tools.
- try different automated execution approaches. The API is simple, there are only a few requests and sequences, so use it to learn a new automated execution tool. It won't change as you are automating, if something goes wrong then it is most likely some nuance of the tool.

This simulator is designed to make starting with API testing as simple as possible.

## Suggested Request Sequence

Try the verbs and payloads listed below as a way of making sure your tooling is setup and you understand the absolute basics about API usage and Testing.

### Step 1 - GET all the Entities

Use your API Client to issue a `GET` request on the `/sim/entities` end point.

- `GET` verb will retrieve information from the server.
- The endpoint is a top level endpoint for a domain entity.
- Most REST APIs use a plural endpoint like `entities` or `todos`

```
GET {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities
```

You should see a `200` status code, which means that the request was a success.

In the response you should see a JSON payload with 10 items.

*   Entities 1-10
*   Get all the entities in the simulator

### Step 2 - GET a single Entity

Issue a GET request to `/sim/entities/1`

- by adding `/1` to the endpoint we are requesting the entity with `id` equal to `1`

```
GET {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities/1
```

* The response should have a status code of `200`, meaning `OK`, the API found the item 
* The response should Return the details of entity number 1 

For extra practice try and `GET` other entities (2-8) listed in the `/sim/entities` response

> NOTE: Entities 1-8 are suitable for getting with a 200 response. 9 and 10 are reserved for later simulated scenarios so if you GET them then you may not get the response you are expecting

### Step 3 - Try to GET an Entity that does not exist

A 404 status code is returned when the API cannot find the item requested.

There was no entity with `id` equal to `13` so if we try to `GET` that we will receive a `404` status code in the response.

```
GET {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities/13
```

* Entity does not exist, receive a 404 response
* Try other values for the `id` and see that you receive 404 responses

### Step 4 - Use POST to create an Entity

A `GET` request is used to retrieve information. We can use `POST` to create new items or amend existing items.

- We need to issue a `POST` request to the `/sim/entities` end point.
- We use the top level endpoint without an `id` because we want to create a new entity (if we add an `id` then we are trying to amend a specific entity)
- We also need to add a `body` with the details of the entity we want to create

```
POST {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities
```

With body:

```
    {"name": "bob"}
```

> NOTE: we've tried to make the simulator easy to use so it doesn't actually matter what you add as the payload, you'll still see the response below.

In response you will see that a new entity has been created with `id` 11:

```
{
  "id": 11,
  "name": "bob",
  "description": ""
}
```

The response will also have a `201` status code, which indicates that a new entity was created.

If you look at the headers in the response you will also see a `Location` header containing the endpoint where the created item can be found.

```
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Location: /sim/entities/11
```

You can now issue a `GET` request on `/sim/entities/11` and you'll see the entity returned again.

```
{
  "id":11,
  "name":"bob",
  "description":""
}
```

> NOTE: entity with id 11 does not show in the entities list because no state is stored on the server.

### Step 5 - Use POST to Amend an Entity

With this API you can also use `POST` to amend an entity. We'll amend entity id `10`

Entity 10 is listed in the `/sim/entities` response as:

```
{
  "id":10,
  "name":"entity number 10",
  "description":""
}
```

Issuing a `POST` on endpoint `/sim/entities/10` means that we want to amend a specific entity.

```
POST {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities/10
```

Add a payload which contains the information you want to update:

```
    {"name": "eris"}
```

You will receive a `200` status code.

*   Amend an entity...note we assume you are amending to the payload above, because that is what we return.
*   Will amend Entity with ID 10, to have the name `eris`

Once you amend you can GET this item and check it has amended

```
GET {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities/10
```

```
{
  "id": 10,
  "name": "eris",
  "description": ""
}
```

NOTE: because this is a simulator and nothing has changed on the server if you issue a GET on `/sim/entities` it will show the original name "entity number 10"

### Step 6 - Use PUT to Amend an Entity

You can also use `PUT` with this API to amend the entity.

Let's assume that someone has amended the name back to the original "entity number 10", which we can see if we `GET`

```
GET {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities
```

Entity 10 is listed in the `/sim/entities` response as:

```
{
  "id":10,
  "name":"entity number 10",
  "description":""
}
```

So we will issue a `PUT` request to amend entity with id `10` to have the name `eris`

```
PUT {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities/10
```

With the payload in the body as:

```
    {"name": "eris"}
```

`PUT` and `POST` are not always interchangeable with APIs. For each API you use, read the documentation to learn how the API works.


### Step 7 - DELETE an Entity

We can use the `DELETE` HTTP verb to delete a specific item.

The only entity we can delete is `id` equal to `9`

```
DELETE {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities/9
```

This should respond with a status code of `204` meaning `OK` successfully completed, but no additional information to show in the body of the response.

To check that something is deleted, try to GET it and make sure that you receive a 404 response.

```
GET {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities/9
```

*   if you GET id 9 then you will find it 404's (because it was deleted)

Additional thing to try with `DELETE`:

*   DELETE an entity listed in the `/sim/entities/id` call is forbidden when id < 9
*   Try to DELETE all the entities by using `DELETE` on `/sim/entities` you should see a status `405` meaning that the HTTP verb (method) is not allowed
*   Try to DELETE an entity that does not exist e.g. `/sim/entities/56` you should see a `404` status with an error message

### STEP 8 - Find out what Verbs are allowed with OPTIONS

APIs will often report errors if you use an HTTP Verb on an endpoint that you are not allowed to.

To find out what Verbs, or Methods, we are allowed to use, issue an `OPTIONS` request on the endpoint.

```
OPTIONS {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities
```

By looking at the `Allow` header in the response we can see that we are allowed to `GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, OPTIONS`

If we tried to `DELETE` or `PATCH` then we should receive an appropriate status code of `405`

Try and see:

```
DELETE {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities
```

`DELETE` correctly returns a `405` response as we expected.

And:

```
PATCH {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities
```

Patch returns a `501` status, which indicates a problem with the API. No API should return a `500` range status code as it indicates a server problem:

- `1xx` - Information response
- `2xx` - OK
- `3xx` - Redirect response (check the `Location` header)
- `4xx` - Invalid request - you've sent an incorrect message
- `5xx` - Server error - something went seriously wrong with the API

### STEP 9 - HEAD request

From the `OPTIONS` request we can see that we are allowed to issue `HEAD` requests.

A `HEAD` request is like a `GET` but only the headers are returned. The headers should be the same as those returned from a `GET` request.

Try this by issuing a `HEAD` request.

```
HEAD {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities
```

And compare the response with a `GET` request:

```
GET {{<ORIGIN_URL>}}/sim/entities
```

The headers should be the same.

## Other Things to Try

If you followed all the Simulator steps then you've managed to use your HTTP API Client tool to issue a range of different request types.

If you want to explore the tool more then you could try the experiments below, or move on directly to the [Simple API](/practice-modes/simpleapi)

*   Try changing the Accept header on GET requests to `application/xml` and `application/json`
*   POST/PUT an entity listed in the `/sim/entities/id` call is forbidden for id < 10
*   PATCH and TRACE should be 501 for all end endpoints
*   any other `/sim/*` endpoints should respond with a 404


## Automating Examples

The Simulator is a very simple set of endpoints to automate because it doesn't matter what order the tests run and the results are idempotent so they will always be the same.

I have created an example set of very simple Java `@Test` methods using RestAssured which automate the Simulator.
